INTRODUCTION
============

This module provides support for mounting a MogileFS file store as a local
filesystem using FUSE.

INSTALLATION
============

MogileFS::Client::Fuse utilizes Module::Build for building and installation. To
install run the following commands:

> perl Build.PL
> ./Build
> ./Build test
> ./Build install

USAGE
=====

Currently this module depends on having MogileFS::Plugin::FilePaths active and
enabled for the domain you are mounting.

Once you have the FilePaths plugin enabled for your MogileFS domain, the easiest
way to use this module is to use the included mount-mogilefs binary. The binary
has several command line options for adjusting the configuration, below are the
basic options for usage.

> mount-mogilefs \
>   --daemon \
>   --tracker mogilefs1.example.com \
>   --tracker mogilefs2.example.com \
>   --domain fuse_namespace \
>   /mnt/point

Currently to unmount a mounted MogileFS filesystem use the following command:

fusermount -u /mnt/point
